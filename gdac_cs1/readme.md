GDAC_CS1: Google Data Analytics Certificate - Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study.
Tools/technologies involved: R and Excel.

This is my first project in over 10 years since I was learning "web design/development" with last touching on .NET(VB) and SQL. As such, this is a more of a learning project than a "portfolio" project.

Not initially intended to be a learning one but while working on the graphs/vizes, I discovered https://enarroied.github.io/posts/cyclistic/ and decided to stop where I was since our work was too similar. Eric's case study is far better than what I would have finished with yet we shared the same thought process with identifying "bad data" and overall approach (for the most part; he's more "tech savy" than I). While it was a bit discourging to see someone else had done what I had envisioned for the end result, it did build confidence for me. Not only in my own abilities and skillset but to start thinking about coming up with my own project ideas as well.

Also, tbh, I would have relied too heavily on Eric's work after finding it if I kept on working this. Our data range covers the same months and I did initially want to explore the lat/lng, and stations more in depth. But with Tableau instead of in R as Eric did in his study. Eh, just knowing I was on the right track on this journey is good enough for now.
